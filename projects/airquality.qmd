Analyze air quality from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

## Intro

In this activity, we analyze air quality data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We will use a spreadsheet of Columbus pollutants to track PM2.5 levels and understand the Air Quality Index (AQI) over time. 

## Links to data

* [Air Quality System(AQS)](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data)
* [Download All Air Quality Data (CSV)](./air-quality_all.csv)
* [Download Columbus Pollutants Data (CSV)](./columbus-pollutants.csv)

## Data Dictionary

* PM2.5: Tiny particles in the air that can affect your health.
* AQI: The "Air Quality Index"—a score to tell you how clean or polluted the air is.
* Mean/Median: The average and middle values of the measurements.

Can you find the specific day in June 2023 when the air quality hit 134.9 µg/m³?
